# Automated Testing with Selenium

# Introduction
This repository contains automation testing scripts developed for testing the Various Wedsites.

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
Java Development Kit (JDK),
Selenium WebDriver,
IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse) - optional but recommended

# Configuration
WebDriver Setup: Ensure you have the appropriate WebDriver executable (e.g.,ChromeDriver) in your system PATH or specify its path in the test configuration.
Test Configuration: Update the test configuration file (if applicable) with the URL of your website and any other necessary parameters.

# Writing Tests
Test Classes: Create test classes under the src/test/java directory. Organize your tests logically based on functionality or features.
Test Methods: Write individual test methods within test classes to cover specific scenarios. Utilize Selenium WebDriver commands to interact with elements on the website.

# Reporting
Selenium testing frameworks often provide built-in reporting capabilities. Ensure that test reports are generated and easily accessible for review.

# Best Practices
Keep tests modular and maintainable by following best practices in test automation.
Use explicit waits to handle dynamic elements and ensure test stability.
Implement Page Object Model (POM) for better code organization and maintenance.
